# DMRC_Analysis
Analysis of the Delhi Metro Network using Python and its libraries.
# Overview
This project analyzes data from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to uncover trends in metro station development, visualize their geographical distribution, and gain insights into the growth of the metro network. Interactive visualizations and maps are used to communicate findings effectively.

# Features
Data Analysis: Explore metro station growth trends over time.
Interactive Visualizations: Use Plotly for bar charts to visualize metro station data dynamically.
Geographical Mapping: Create an interactive map with Folium to display metro station locations and color-code them by metro line.
Customization: Easily add or modify metro lines and station data.
